# Image-Colorization
The project colorizes black and white images which fools humans to think they are real.
 We will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network capable of colorizing black and white images with results.The input black and white images are converted to Color Images using CNN and the output images are displayed.Use the sample images from the folder and the output images will be saved in the output folder.
